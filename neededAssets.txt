Visual Asset Guidelines:
	SVG format would be prefered due to the amount of scaling that is done;
	PNG's are acceptable.
		- I would prefer min 64x64 if not using svg.
	All map images should be square in dimentions otherwise they may look squashed due to scaling.

Visual Assets Needed:
	- Map Tiles
		- Grass
			- Multiple Variations are possible
		- Water
		- Roads
			- Needs variations to cover possible connections
				- unconnected
				- dead end
				- straight through
				- curve
				- three way
				- 4 way
			- I will cover rotations in code
	- Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Buildings
		- Need to have multiple tiers
			- Im thinking of doing 5 tiers total for these.
		- Possibly different variations for each tier
	- Resource Nodes:
		-Un-Established
			- Ore Mine
			- Forest
			- Farm
		- Established 
			- 3 Tiers
	- Special Structures
		- Research Lab


-- Secondary List ( Not needed/implemented yet)
	- Utility Stuctures
		- Water Pump
		- Wind Mill
		- Solar Panel
		- Coal Power Plant
		- Nuclear Power Plant
		- Pipes
